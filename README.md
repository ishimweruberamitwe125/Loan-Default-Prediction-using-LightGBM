# Loan-Default-Prediction-using-LightGBM
This project uses a LightGBM model to predict loan default risk for clients with little to no credit history. Traditional credit data limitations often lead to the denial of loans to potentially creditworthy individuals. By applying advanced data science techniques, this project aims to help in that manner.
